    <p>Hi, I’m Samaira, a second year BTech CSE student here at NSUT. I enjoy problem solving and love a good challenge. Coding is my favorite kind of puzzle and it’s the one activity that makes me feel fully in sync with myself. Outside of tech, I play the sitar and occasionally paint or sketch when I need to reset.</p>

        <h3>Amazon Employee Database Manager</h3>
        <p>Made this in Class 12 using Python and MySQL. It lets you add, update, delete and view employee records through a simple terminal interface. I also added some extras like input checks and better formatting just to make it smoother to use. It really helped me understand how databases and Python can work together.</p>
